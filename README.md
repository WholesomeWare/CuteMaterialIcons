### Creating icons digitally

Icons must follow a few specifications:

- format: `PNG`
- image size: `48x48`
- icon size in the image: `40x40`
- black icon on transparent background

If you finished an icon, make a pull request or send them to the [owner of this repository](https;//github.com/CsakiTheOne). If you send your icons directly to me, please name it beforehand as shown below:

Path to an icon should be: `/icons/ic_<icon_name>/ic_<icon_name>_<size>.png`

For example if you remade the icon `More Vert`: `/idons/ic_more_vert/ic_more_vert_48.png`

### Drawing icons on paper

If you prefer drawing on paper, you can still contribute, by scanning your drawings. There is a separate folder in this repository for paper drawings [here](./drawings/).

If you finished drawing, make a pull request or send them to the owner of this repository. If you send your icons directly to me, please name it beforehand as shown below:

- if image shows 1 icon: `ic_<icon_name>`
- if image shows multiple icons: `icons_<count>`
